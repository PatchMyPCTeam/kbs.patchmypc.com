On the 20th Septemeber 2024, [Microsoft announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-server-update-services-wsus-deprecation/ba-p/4250436) the deprecation of **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)**, encouraging their customers to explore more modern update management solutions. Despite this announcement, **Patch My PC customers are unaffected**. WSUS will continue to be supported in its current state, and no action is required by our customers. This article explains the deprecation in more detail and reassures customers about its non-impact on their environments.

### Microsoft Announcement <a href="#h-microsoft-announcement" id="h-microsoft-announcement"></a>

Microsoft announced the deprecation of **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).** Deprecation, in this context, means that Microsoft are no longer adding new features or accepting requests for them. However, existing functionality will remain, and updates will continue to be published through the WSUS channel. It has been confirmed that WSUS will still be available on **Windows Server 2025** and beyond.

Importantly, there are also no current plans to remove the WSUS feature from existing supported Windows Server versions.

At Patch My PC, we understand that this notice from Microsoft may raise concerns with our customers. In short, the WSUS deprecation announcement will have **no immediate effect** on our customers existing patching processes.

**No Action Required**\
You can continue using WSUS as part of your existing update management workflows. Our service will continue to support WSUS, allowing you to receive updates and patches as usual.

**Long-Term Support**\
WSUS will remain available in its current form, with no end-of-life date announced yet. Patch My PC will monitor closely any further announcements from Microsoft that may affect compatibility and long-term support for our customers who are leveraging WSUS.

**Future Planning**\
While WSUS is being deprecated, we do have a plan to ensure any future updates to Microsoft’s strategy will not negatively impact our customers.

For customers using **Configuration Manager**, WSUS remains a critical component for updates. Microsoft has confirmed that WSUS deprecation will not impact existing capabilities or ConfigMgr’s integration.

In the unlikely scenario where WSUS is discontinued, **Patch My PC** has prepared for alternative approaches to ensure updates for third-party applications will continue seamlessly.

### Summary <a href="#h-summary" id="h-summary"></a>

Microsoft’s WSUS deprecation is a significant industry development, but not unexpected given it has had very few feature enhancments in the last 10 years. Our customers can continue to rely on Patch My PC for their update management needs without making any immediate changes to their processes.

For customers using co-management in Configuration Manager or considering moving to **Microsoft Intune** for client operating system updates, **Patch My PC** can help you navigate this transition to understand the impact on third-party patching. We can also assist in migrating the third-party applications and updates workload to Intune.

We remain committed to providing you with seamless patching solutions and will handle any future transitions in a way that ensures uninterrupted service.
