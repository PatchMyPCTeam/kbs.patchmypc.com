This article will describe how to quickly find the correct **Configuration Manager database server name** and **database name**.

### Set the Configuration Manager Database Server and Database Name

To find the database server and database name, navigate to **Administration** > **Monitoring** > **System Status** > **Site Status**Â in your configuration manager console.

Here you will find the Site database server site system that contains the details required.

### Are You Using a Custom SQL Server Instance for the Site Database?

Although less common, if you are using a custom SQL instance, use **%Server%%Instancename%** in the Server Name input box.

## Limit Scanning to a Specific Collection

By default, the device collection is not set. When empty, the scan for support products is performed against **All Systems**.

**Optionally**, you can choose a device collection by clicking the browse icon.

When a device collection is enabled, the results for detected applications will be **filtered to devices in the specified collection**.
