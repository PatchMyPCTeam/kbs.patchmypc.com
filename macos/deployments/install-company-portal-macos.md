To install and manage optional apps on macOS devices provided by your organization through Intune, users need the **Company Portal app**.

Devices enrolled via **Automated Device Enrollment** or **direct enrollment** may have the Company Portal app installed automatically. However, **personally owned** or **manually enrolled** devices require users to download and install the app themselves.

This article explains how to manually install the Company Portal app on macOS.

## Requirements

- The device must be running macOS 11 or later.

- The device is already [enrolled into Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/user-help/enroll-your-device-in-intune-macos-cp#enroll-your-mac).
