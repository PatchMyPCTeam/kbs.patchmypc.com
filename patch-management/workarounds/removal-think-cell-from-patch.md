Patch My PC will be removing the think-cell product from its catalog on March 17, 2025.

Patch My PC engineers have worked closely with think-cell, and it has been determined by both parties that Patch My PC's update methodology does not work well with think-cell products due to several factors including:

- Updates from think-cell are pushed in waves to all think-cell customers

- Many think-cell customers receive a custom installation MSI that will not match the MSI provided by Patch My PC

After receiving numerous support cases, Patch My PC engineers met with think-cell and concluded that the best course of action is to remove this product from the Patch My PC Catalog at this time. Think-cell recommends utilizing their auto-updater to manage think-cell updates.

Additionally, think-cell offers the following resources to help manage updates for the think-cell product using their auto-updater:
