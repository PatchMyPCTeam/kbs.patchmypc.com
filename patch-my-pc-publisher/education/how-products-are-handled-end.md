We remove products from our [supported products](/supported-products) list for a few reasons. The primary reasons for products being removed from our catalog are:

- The product is [End-of-Life](#topic1) (EOL) by the vendor

- Other compatibility issues related to silent install or versioning

## Process and Timeline for Products Reaching End-of-Life

When a product nears it's official end-of-life date, the following actions will be taken by Patch My PC. Patch My PC will attempt to adhere to the following timeline, assuming we are aware of the scheduled end-of-life of an application.

- **3 Months Prior to End-of-Life**
    - Notification in [catalog release notes page](https://patchmypc.com/category/scupcatalogupdates) and [newsletter](https://patchmypc.com/scup-catalog-newsletter-signup) of EOL and removal of application from the Patch My PC Catalog

- **1 Month Prior to End-of-Life**
    - Notification in catalog release notes page and newsletter of EOL and removal of application from the Patch My PC Catalog

- **1 Week Prior to End-of-Life**
    - Notification in catalog release notes page and newsletter of EOL and removal of application from the Patch My PC Catalog

- **Day of End-of-Life**
    - Notification in catalog release notes page and newsletter of EOL and removal of application from the Patch My PC Catalog
    
    - Unsupported application is expired in the Patch My PC Catalog, and can no longer be published
    
    - Product is made unavailable as a ConfigMgr App, Intune App and Intune Update
        - Product will remain available under "Updates" tab so that the Publisher can expire the Update in WSUS on the next sync

- **1 Month Post Application End-of-Life**
    - Unsupported application is removed from the Patch My PC Catalog
