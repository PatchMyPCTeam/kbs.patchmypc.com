The supportability of older releases of the **[Patch My PC Publisher](/docs)** is covered in this article.

## The cadence of Patch My PC Publisher Releases

Our goal is to continually improve our software to meet customer needs based on feedback from our customers on our **[UserVoice portal](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/)**. Generally, we release a new build of our publisher **at least once a month** to address feature requests, improvements, and bug fixes.

You can review our past release history for production builds using the following resource **[Patch My PC Publisher Production Release History](https://patchmypc.com/category/releases/production-releases)**. You can also review our **[public roadmap](https://patchmypc.com/roadmap)** to stay up to date on features under development.

## Supportability for Old Versions of the Publisher

We only support a Publisher release **up to 4 months after it was first released** to our **[production release channel](/category/releases/production-releases)**. We will ask you to upgrade to a supported build if you are running an unsupported build to receive support.

> **Note:** Patch My PC does not recommend disabling the self-update feature in the About tab unless required.
