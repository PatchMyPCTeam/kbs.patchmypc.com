Since we added [Intune integration](https://patchmypc.com/automatically-create-and-deploy-applications-in-microsoft-intune) a couple of years ago, we have continued to invest in innovation, bringing more and more functionality to those who use our product to deploy and patch applications using Intune.

Therefore, we wanted to take this moment to reflect and discuss upcoming price changes, newly added premium features, and roadmap ambitions related to our Intune integration.

## Evolving Our Integration with Microsoft Intune

We have learned through experience while building both integrations for Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) and Intune – that there are many differences in features and functionality capabilities between the products. In addition, many customers who migrate from ConfigMgr to Intune learn about these differences firsthand. The most obvious high-level example of this is that patching in ConfigMgr is built on top of WSUS; however, Intune has no equivalent for publishing self-authored or third-party patch catalogs.

Therefore, to create third-party patching in Intune, we had to make [infrastructure investments](https://patchmypc.com/third-party-patch-management-for-microsoft-intune) to provide functionality similar to that which is already in ConfigMgr. While this is a challenge – we also see this as an opportunity to innovate and build increasingly more value-added functionality to our Intune subscription for our customers. Our ambitions around functionality we hope to bring to our customers include reporting, vulnerability tracking, auditing, grouping, and targeting improvements.

## Intune Subscription Price Increase

On **June 1, 2022**, we will be increasing the price of our Intune subscription from **$2.50 per endpoint/year** to **$3.25 per endpoint/year** for all new purchases. Since the release of our Intune subscription in March 2020, the price has remained the same and the primary factor for the increase is innovation and new functionality.

Initially, the Intune subscription only supported creating applications for the initial installation of software to devices. One example of a significant improvement is the ability to deploy **[third-party updates to existing devices](https://patchmypc.com/third-party-patch-management-for-microsoft-intune)** now.

Some other noteworthy improvements for Microsoft Intune we released are:

- [Manage Enrollment Status Pages](https://patchmypc.com/manage-intune-enrollment-status-pages)

- [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications)

- [Override Win32 application options](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#override-win32)

- [Manage naming convention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#IntuneNamingConvention)

- [Manage security scopes](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#security-scopes)

- [Manage categories](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#ManageCategories)

- [Manage application update and retention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#new-application)

## Intune Subscription Renewal for Existing Customers

We understand that price changes can be challenging from a budgeting perspective for existing customers. As a result, existing customers can keep their current subscription with all existing features and **renew their Intune / Intune Essentials subscription** for one renewal period at the previous **$2.50 per endpoint/year** rather than the new **$3.25 per endpoint/year**.

## Renaming the Intune Subscription

Historically, the perception has been that we have a subscription called **Intune,** which is the only subscription you would want or need for integration with Microsoft Intune. However, as we add more and more sophisticated features, there may be features that we add only to our Enterprise Plus subscription. This model has always been the case on the ConfigMgr side, where basic features are included with the Enterprise Patch subscription. More valuable features are included with the Enterprise Plus subscription.

This change will bring us to parity on the Intune side. We are renaming the **Intune** subscription to **Intune Essentials** to clarify this point. It will be all the features and value that have always been there, just under a new name; and **both ConfigMgr and Intune integration will have more premium features in the Enterprise Plus subscription**. We can’t wait to reveal some of the innovations we’re excited about on our roadmap.

## Introducing Premium Intune Features in Our Enterprise Plus Subscription

As you may have seen [last week](https://docs.patchmypc.com/release-history/production-releases) – we have added some very intriguing improvements and features for our customers using Intune. Some of these newly added features are a part of our Enterprise Plus subscription. The **three new features that are only included in Enterprise Plus** are:

- [Manage Dynamic Assignments](https://patchmypc.com/manage-dynamic-assignments) for deploying third-party updates based on security criteria such as CVEs or update classification data.
    - You can review how this feature works in our [new feature video here](https://youtu.be/MuyWXtoSuBM?t=192).

- Support for [adding Intune Filters](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#filters) when assigning applications.
    - You can review how this feature works in our [new feature video here](https://youtu.be/MuyWXtoSuBM?t=703).

- [Pause Product Updates](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#pause-product-updates) can allow you to pause updates for a specific product until a future date.
    - You can review how this feature works in our [new feature video here](https://youtu.be/MuyWXtoSuBM?t=905).

We will continue to innovate, and more premium features will be available in our Enterprise Plus subscription for both Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Configuration Manager in the future.
