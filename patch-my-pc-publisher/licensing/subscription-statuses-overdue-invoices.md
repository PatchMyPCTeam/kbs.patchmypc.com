### Subscription Statuses for Overdue Invoices

In this article, we are going to review different subscription states when invoices are overdue.

### At-Risk Subscription Status

If payment is overdue to 60 days, your subscription will be marked as **at-risk.** An at-risk subscription means you are at risk of being **suspended** due to a lack of payment.

When a subscription is **at-risk**, you will receive the following notifications within our publisher tool.

If you click the **At-risk of suspension** label, you will receive a message about why your subscription was marked as **at-risk**.

> **Note:** An **at-risk** subscription will still function and allow the catalog to be processed and publish new third-party software updates or applications to Microsoft Intune or Configuration Manager.

### Suspended Subscription Status

Generally, a subscription may be **suspended** when the payment of an invoice is over 90 days overdue. When a subscription is suspended, access to our catalog will be removed. You will be unable to publish any new third-party updates or applications to your Microsoft Intune or Configuration Manager environment.

When a subscription is **suspended**, you will receive the following notifications within our publisher tool.
