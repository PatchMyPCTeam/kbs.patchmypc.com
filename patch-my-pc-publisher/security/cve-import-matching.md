The ability to **bulk match** Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) has been a popular request on our **[UserVoice](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-916)**. We’re excited to release our **CVE Import Wizard** feature that will allow you to bulk match a list of CVEs from a **CSV** or **Text** file and display details about the status of the CVEs in the document.

## The Basics of the CVE Import Wizard

Our CVE Import Wizard is designed to **help track the status of a list of CVEs**. The most common use case is a security team will provide a .CSV file containing a list of CVEs for tracking. Our tool will then query the **following data sources** to determine if the CVE has any matches:

- Software updates already published to WSUS/SCCM

- All available updates in our third-party update catalog metadata

The CVE scan will quickly allow you to **bulk match a list of CVEs** to understand if the fix for the security vulnerability is available from Patch My PC or if you may need to resolve the vulnerability using another mechanism.

## How the CVE Import Wizard Works

To open the CVE Import Wizard, go to the **Updates** tab in the Publisher and click the **Security Document** button.

Click the **Browse…** button to select a CSV file containing a list of CVE IDs and then click **Process**. After the processing is complete, you will see the list of all CVE IDs detected in the table grouped by the state.

- **Available** = An update is available within the catalog, but it is not published within your environment yet.

- **Published** = The update is already published to WSUS/SCCM and is available for deployment.

- **Unavailable** = No update is published that contains that CVE ID and there is no update in our catalog matching it.

Here’s an example of a CSV file that contained **15 CVE IDs** within it.

You can also check the checkbox to **Group By Products**. When enabled, the wizard will **group the list of CVE IDs to the Product** that had a match for that CVE ID.

## Importing Available Updates Matching CVE IDs

One important **actionable item** in the CVE Import Wizard is publishing **third-party updates on-demand** based on the scan results. If updates are in an **Available** state, they can be selected and published on-demand.

You can either individually select updates in an **Available** state or click the **Select All Available** button.

Once you have selected the updates you want to publish-on-demand, you can click the **Import Selected Patches**. After clicking the Import Selected Patches button, you will receive a dialog box to monitor the **[PatchMyPC.log file](https://patchmypc.com/collecting-log-files-for-patch-my-pc-support#publishing-service-logs)**.

The **[PatchMyPC.log](https://patchmypc.com/collecting-log-files-for-patch-my-pc-support#publishing-service-logs)** file will show the selected updates being published.

> **Note:** Even if the product for a selected update isn’t enabled in the **Updates** tab, any update selected in the CVE Import Wizard will be **automatically published on-demand** if the Import Selected Patches is clicked.

## Alerts for On-Demand Importing of Patches for CVEs

When using the Import Select Patches options, you will receive an **email alert** after the synchronization of selected updates is complete if **[SMTP emails are enabled](https://patchmypc.com/how-publishing-alerts-work)**. The email will contain important details about the CVE ID scan against the CSV file.

If **[Microsoft Teams alerts are enabled](https://patchmypc.com/how-publishing-alerts-work#topic2)**[](https://patchmypc.com/how-publishing-alerts-work#topic2), you will receive normal teams alerts for any published updates **in real-time** as shown below:
