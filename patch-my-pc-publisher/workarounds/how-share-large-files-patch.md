There may be some cases when working with our support team where you may need to share **large files** with us for troubleshooting.

A few **examples** are:

- **Package source** files for ConfigMgr applications

- **Installer** binaries

- Multiple **large log files** that are larger than 20 MB that can't be sent via email

## Step 1: Prepare the Files that will be Uploaded

The first step is to **prepare** the files you are sending. We recommend compressing the files into a **single .zip archive file** before uploading.

We also recommend **renaming the .zip file** with a descriptive name, including your company name. Here's an example:

## Step 2: Upload the ZIP-File to Sharepoint

Next, you will need to **upload the .zip file** created in step 1 to our Sharepoint website.

Navigate to: **[https://patchmypc.com/share](https://patchmypc.com/share)** in a web browser.

Choose **Select files**

In the **file browse dialog**, select the file(s) you need to upload for support.

Next, you need to enter your **first** and **last** name. Optionally, you can also select the **\+ Add more files** link it applicable to include more files. Once filled out, click **Upload**.

Once the **upload is completed**, the support engineer working on your case will be notified.

## Upload Application Source Files for Troubleshooting

There may be some cases where our support team may request **application source files** for an SCCM application created by Patch My PC. To upload application source files, ZIP the primary folder referenced in the deployment type **Content** tab. You can then upload the files using the **[previous step](#topic3)**.
